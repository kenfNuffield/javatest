Java test.

Instructions.
This starter Maven project is incomplete, it needs to be finished.  
The code is now yours to do as you see fit, the only elements that are fixed are the input and output files formats.
All elements will be assessed e.g. code style, readability, comments, javadoc, logging, functional efficiency, unit testing, knowledge of Java etc.
Consider the use of standard patterns, for example a Builder or Factory might be useful.  
Code needs to be committed to the git repository in logical batches, i.e. don't do one big commit of everything, commit as you go.

The Problem.
This is a transformer, input is JSON, read the order1.json file and transform according to the XML schema.
Output an xml file, with a unique filename, to an output folder that is created if it doesn't exist.
